<h1>What is RandAni?</h1>
<img class ="corey" src="images/corey.jpeg"/>
<p>
    Hello! RandAni was created by Corey Michaud to provide a simple way to find a wide range of information on animals through Wikipedia articles. 
    This is for anyone wanting to educate themselves on species of animals unknown to them, as well as expand their knowledge and hopefully 
    broaden their view on the way they see animals in their everyday life. 
</p>
<p>
    I created RandAni during ShellHacks 2020 where I was allowed a maximum of 36 hours to code this website from start to finish. It 
    taught me how to more efficiently write code in a shorter period of time, as well as how to use flexbox and use a JavaScript function 
    within HTML5 code to provide interactability from the website to the user.
